Current Implementation

You can switch between:
* **An email module**: The email module allows users to see emails in the left side panel and then when an email is clicked the full email will be displayed in the main panel.
* **A map module**: The map modules allows users to click different territories in the map and then a zoomed in map of the territory will be shown.
* **A calendar module**: The calendar module allows users to see different events that the user can participate in for the game. Once currectly implemented the user can click the event and a mini game will start.
