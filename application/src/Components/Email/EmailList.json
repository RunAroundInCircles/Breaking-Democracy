You play the role of Putin instructing the FSB on taking measures against the fictional country of Democristan in order to get a specific Russian aligned candidate elected.\n This Email box will be used to provide you with important information as you progress through the game.\nThe Map button will show the current poll results of Democristan. \nThe Echo button will open a mock social media app that will update with story and flavor text as you progress. \nThe Calendar button opens a calendar which shows all of the major events of the election, this is where interference happens, to start simply click on an event and you will start a minigame.  \nThe Timeline button will record your actions in the Calendar and show you how well you are doing.\n\nGood Luck.",

They are backed by the United States so we must act discreetly. It is up to us to ensure the greatness of Russia to continue on, and we won’t stand for these separatists to do as they please. In the coming months we will be relying on your guidance and instructions with how to interfere. We’ll leave it up to you to decide what the best course of action is for Russia.\n\nSincerely,\nDirector of FSB",

Doing the same kind of interference close together is less effective, so make sure to mix it up.  We’ll be providing new kinds of interference as the election progresses to help you stay on top of things.\nWe're working to get in touch with Dimitri Patrov as his stances are very sympathetic to our goals. I recommend trying to get his party elected.  This means trying to get every region to be as purple as possible, i.e. make the polls 50% liberal and 50% conservative. Good Luck. \n\nSincerely,\nFSB Director",
