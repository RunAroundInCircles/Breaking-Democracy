          Hello my fellow Democristans, I am Lyra Whit; the front runner for the Democristan Liberal Party. As a newly formed country I believe that we have endless potential, however the Democristan Conservative Party is too concerned with mimicking the ways of western politics.  Democristan must break free and forge its own path to a new future.
